# Pantheon

An experimental interface inspired by the animated series **Pantheon**. It is built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

Open `index.html` to explore the futuristic chat UI. The front end communicates with `http://localhost:3000/api/ask` for responses, so you can attach your own Flowise AI backend and maintain conversation history.

## New Features

The interface now mirrors the core layout of ChatGPT and includes a few quality of life improvements:

* Conversations can be renamed or deleted directly from the sidebar.
* The current chat can be cleared without removing the conversation itself.
* Layout tweaks better match ChatGPT's familiar look and feel.
* Toggle between light and dark themes.
* Messages include timestamps and a copy button.
* Conversations can be exported to JSON.
* New purple color scheme inspired by the show.
* An "About Pantheon" modal provides background on the series.
* Sleek glassmorphism styling and a modern gradient theme.
